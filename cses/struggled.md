# Questions that I needed to Google/watch a tutorial for

2205_gray_code
- Finding the pattern in prepending in the recursive solution, and flipping it so that the ends differ by 1

1754_coin_piles
- Arriving to the mathematical equation of 2x + y = a and x + 2y = b divisible by 3 (which means a + b must also be divisible by 3)
- Swap around to get the equation for a certain code

1618_trailing_zeros
- Seeing the pattern of trailing zero = % 10. Using the factors 2 * 5 and seeing that 2 appears more often (in even numbers)
- Then using a recursive // 5 + // 5 to count every occurance of 5

1092_two_sets
- Failed to see the pattern where the first and last will add up to the same sum
- For the odd, number n can be added at the end and we just solve for the even portion

2165_tower_of_hanoi
- How the fuck did they discover this...
- Shift n-1 from A to B (aux C)
- Shift A to C
- Shift n-1 from B to C (aux A)

1623_apple_division and 1624_chessboard_and_queens
- Both have the same theory behind it
- Recursion and return at base case where we're at the end
- For each location choose to either place it here (and then recurse) or not place it
- Get the max or the sum
